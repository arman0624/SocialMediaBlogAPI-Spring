# Social Media Blog API - Spring

## Background 

This project is a backend for a hypothetical social media app that manages usersâ€™ accounts as well as any messages that they submit to the application. The application functions as a micro-blogging or messaging app. Any user can see all of the messages posted to the site or any messages posted by a particular user. In either case, the backend delivers the data needed to display this information as well as process actions like logins, registrations, message creations, message updates, and message deletions. This is all done with Spring and Spring Boot.

## Database Tables
